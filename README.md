In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn,
numpy, pandas, and xgboost, I have build a model using an XGBClassifier. I have
loaded the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset,
build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
